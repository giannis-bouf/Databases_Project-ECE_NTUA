# Databases - ECE NTUA

This project consists of a fully-working database implemented from scratch in SQL (default data for db setup are available) and a web application GUI in JSon and HTML.
The subject of the project is the development of an application for book lending and the database that handles the data. 
The application features a user, a moderator and a general administrator interface.

Enjoy 😊
